# Geometric-Deep-Learning-Papers
This repository contains papers I have read on micro-level modeling and deep learning, building foundations for optimized equivariant neural network applications in medicine. Topics covered include Equivariant Neural Networks, Geometric Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Material Science.

## Material Science and Simulation
1. MatterSim: A Deep Learning Atomistic Model Across Elements, Temperatures, and Pressures. ( Microsoft Research AI for Science, May 2024)
2. Learning local equivariant representations for large-scale atomistic dynamics (Harvard University, Robert Bosch LLC Research and Technology Center, Cambridge, January 2023)
